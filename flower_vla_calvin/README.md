##  FLOWER: An efficient & versatile Flow-VLA

FLOWER VLA is a lightweight, efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy for robotic manipulation tasks that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Built on a rectified flow architecture with several key architecture features:

- **Efficient Architecture**: At ~1B parameters, FLOWER is significantly smaller than most VLA models
- **Low Training Cost**: Only requires ~200 GPU hours of pretraining
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Uses <3GB of GPU memory for inference with single image setting
- **SOTA Performance**: Achieves sota results on CALVIN and LIBERO benchmarks 

For the pretraining of FLOWER and finetuning for Aloha check out our other codebase.


## Model Overview

FLOWER VLA uses a Florence-2-large-based VLM combined with a rectified flow architecture to predict robot actions from visual observations and language instructions. 
The model efficiently handles multi-step action sequences through a chunking mechanism.

[Insert model architecture diagram here]

Key architectural components:
- Florence-2 DaVit Image Encoder [350M params]
- Language conditioning through cross-attention 
- Half of the Florence-2 LLM layers for vision and language fusion [205M]
- Rectified Flow Predition for fast action generation (all results in CALVIN and LIBERO are achieved using just 4 denoising steps) 
- Global AdaLN for parameter efficient conditioning
- Action chunking for multi-step action generation


## Installation
To begin, clone this repository locally
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:intuitive-robots/flower_vla_calvin.git
export flower_calvin_ROOT=$(pwd)/flower_vla_calvin

```
Install requirements
(Note we provided a changed verison of pyhash, given numerous problems we encountered when installing it manually on our slurm cluster)
You can also try to install setup tools using pip. 
 
```bash
cd $flower_calvin_ROOT
conda create -n flower_cal python=3.9
conda activate flower_cal
cd calvin_env/tacto
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install -e .
cd ..
cd LIBERO
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pip install numpy~=1.23
cd ..
pip install setuptools==57.5.0
cd pyhash-0.9.3
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
cd ..
```
Next we can install the rest of the missing packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download
### CALVIN Dataset

If you want to train on the [CALVIN](https://github.com/mees/calvin) dataset, choose a split with:
```bash
cd $flower_calvin_ROOT/dataset
sh download_data.sh D | ABCD
```

## Training
To train the FLOWER FLOWERl with the 4 GPUS, run:
```
python flower/training.py 
```

You can use the pretrained FLOWER checkpoint from [hf-link](https://huggingface.co/mbreuss/flower_vla_pret) to train your own model on any of the datasets. 

Note that during training the full CALVIN eval or LIBERO rollouts will be called after _rollout_lh_skip_epochs_ and then every _callbacks.rollout_lh.rollout_freq_*1k training steps. Check out the training config for adopting the parameters.

For replication of the orginial training results I recommend to use 4 GPUs with a batch_size of 8 and train them for 40k steps for ABC (ABCD) and evaluating after 19 epochs to get the best possible results.
See training configs for details.

#### Preprocessing with CALVIN
Since FLOWER uses action chunking, it needs to load multiple (~10) `episode_{}.npz` files for each inference. In combination with batching, this results in a large disk bandwidth needed for each iteration (usually ~2000MB/iteration).
This has the potential of significantly reducing your GPU utilization rate during training depending on your hardware.
Therefore, you can use the script `extract_by_key.py` to extract the data into a single file, avoiding opening too many episode files when using the CALVIN dataset.

##### Usage example:
```shell
python preprocess/extract_by_key.py -i /YOUR/PATH/TO/CALVIN/ \
    --in_task all
```

```
python preprocess/extract_by_key.py -i /hkfs/work/workspace/scratch/ft4740-play3/data --in_task all
```

##### Params:
Run this command to see more detailed information:
```shell
python preprocess/extract_by_key.py -h
```

Important params:
* `--in_root`: `/YOUR/PATH/TO/CALVIN/`, e.g `/data3/geyuan/datasets/CALVIN/`
* `--extract_key`: A key of `dict(episode_xxx.npz)`, default is **'rel_actions'**, the saved file name depends on this (i.e `ep_{extract_key}.npy`)
Optional params:
* `--in_task`: default is **'all'**, meaning all task folders (e.g `task_ABCD_D/`) of CALVIN
* `--in_split`: default is **'all'**, meaning both `training/` and `validation/`
* `--out_dir`: optional, default is **'None'**, and will be converted to `{in_root}/{in_task}/{in_split}/extracted/`
* `--force`: whether to overwrite existing extracted data
Thanks to @ygtxr1997 for debugging the GPU utilization and providing a merge request.

#### Common Issues

Sometimes this causes problems for the python env so just delete it:

```python
log.info(f"Using calvin_env with commit {get_git_commit_hash(Path(calvin_env.__file__))}.")
```
